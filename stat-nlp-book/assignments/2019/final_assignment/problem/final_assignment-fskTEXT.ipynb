    "For this task, you are not confined to the training data provided to you, but you are welcome to obtain additional unlabelled datasets and automatically label them using weak supervision methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general setup will otherwise be the same as for Task 1:\n",
    "As input to it, you will have the plain input texts as well as `.ann` files containing gold (i.e. correct) keyphrase annotations. The output should be `.ann` files containing relations between those keyphrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important notes**:\n",
    "- You must provide code for the functions below. \n",
    "- If running them on the full dataset exceeds the 10 minute limit, you are welcome to additionally provide a line of code that (down)loads the already weakly annotated data.\n",
    "- The maximum file size for weakly annotated data may not exceed 1GB.\n",
