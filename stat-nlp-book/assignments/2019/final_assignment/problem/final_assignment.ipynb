In this conversion, several entites have to be removed, as entities overlap. In this case, the longest entities have been kept. This also leads to a slight loss in the number of relations, as some of these referes to entities, which are removed due to overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Removing references\n",
    "Several texts have references. In most cases however, these do not add any value to the understanding, and this thus only noise for our model. Furthermore, references are often in the sentence between hyponyms and hypernyms. An example, where the references can complicate the relation detection can be seen in the first row below, where a reference is in between the entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Concatenating 'e.g.' and 'i.e.'\n",
    "Multiple entities with relations a mentioned with 'XXXX, e.g. YYYY' and 'XXXX, i.e. YYYY'. An example of both of these cases can be seen in line 2 and 3 in the table below. If the tokens are split as 'e', '.', 'g' and '.', it may very well be more difficult for the model to learn, than if it is a single token.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Downscaling\n",
    "With the format as above, the dataset is severely imbalanced with 99% of the entities having no relation. This would make it almost impossible for the model to train. Therefore for all entities mentioned in different sentences, no relationship is assumed, and these datapoints are removed. This reduces the size of that data sets with roughly 80%, and in the train data, this corresponds to removing 45785 data points with no relations and while only catching 5 datapoints with a relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Upscaling\n",
    "As the dataset after imbalance is still significantly biased (with ~95% of datapoints having no relations), the datapoints with relations is artificially upscaled with a factor 10. This will hopefully get the model to learn the features for relations faster. The upscaling will naturally only be done on the training set, and the development set will then be used to rescale the probabilities again. <br>\n",

This is feared to give too many parameters however, which both takes a long time to train and with a higher risk of overfitting. To remedy this, a PCA has been performed on the FastText embeddings in order to decrease the vector size without and still keeping the maximal distance between the different vectors in the space, so these can still be separated."
