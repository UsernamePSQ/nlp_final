    "In this assignment, you will build a relation extraction model for scientific articles based on the [ScienceIE dataset](https://scienceie.github.io/) in a group of up to 3 students. This is the same dataset that was used for Assignment 2, where you had to train a model to extract keyphrases. You are welcome to build on code any team member already wrote for Assignment 2.\n",

Stress corrosion cracking in pressurized water reactors (PWSCC) occurs in Alloy 600 in safety critical components, such as steam generator tubes, heater sleeves, pressurized instrument penetrations and control rod drive mechanisms [2,6,7].

You are not required to change the relation extraction model architure, i.e. it is fine to re-use the one from Task 1, but instead, the requirements are to implement one or more weak supervision strategies.\n",

    "Some possible weak supervision methods for relation extraction will be introduced in the lecture Week 43 (https://github.com/copenlu/stat-nlp-book/blob/master/chapters/relation_extraction_slides.ipynb); the following blog post also serves as a good introduction to this topic: https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/blog/ws_blog_post.html\n",

    "For this task, you are not confined to the training data provided to you, but you are welcome to obtain additional unlabelled datasets and automatically label them using weak supervision methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general setup will otherwise be the same as for Task 1:\n",
    "As input to it, you will have the plain input texts as well as `.ann` files containing gold (i.e. correct) keyphrase annotations. The output should be `.ann` files containing relations between those keyphrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important notes**:\n",
    "- You must provide code for the functions below. \n",
    "- If running them on the full dataset exceeds the 10 minute limit, you are welcome to additionally provide a line of code that (down)loads the already weakly annotated data.\n",
    "- The maximum file size for weakly annotated data may not exceed 1GB.\n",
