In this conversion, several entites have to be removed, as entities overlap. In this case, the longest entities have been kept. This also leads to a slight loss in the number of relations, as some of these referes to entities, which are removed due to overlap.\n",
    "\n",

    "Several texts have references. In most cases however, these do not add any value to the understanding, and this thus only noise for our model. Furthermore, references are often in the sentence between hyponyms and hypernyms. An example, where the references can complicate the relation detection can be seen in the first row below, where a reference is in between the entities.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Downscaling\n",
    "With the format as above, the dataset is severely imbalanced with 99% of the entities having no relation. This would make it almost impossible for the model to train. Therefore for all entities mentioned in different sentences, no relationship is assumed, and these datapoints are removed. This reduces the size of that data sets with roughly 80%, and in the train data, this corresponds to removing 45785 data points with no relations and while only catching 5 datapoints with a relation.\n",

    "As the dataset after imbalance is still significantly biased (with ~95% of datapoints having no relations), the datapoints with relations is artificially upscaled with a factor 10. This will hopefully get the model to learn the features for relations faster. The upscaling will naturally only be done on the training set, and the development set will then be used to rescale the probabilities again. <br>\n",

The scientific nature of data has the consequence that a lot of our tokens cannot be found in such a limited FastText model.<br>\n",
    "To alleviate this issue, we introduce another FastText model with a vocabulary of 350 000 words. We then check each token in our vocabulary from data. If a specific token is found in the rich FastText model, but not the limited one, we add the token to our limited FastText model from the rich FastText model. This approach means that we eventually add roughly 7500 extra words to the vocabulary of our limited FastText model - such that it contains a total of 22'5000 words. This results in a relatively small FastText model with an impressive 89% coverage of tokens in vocabulary from data.

    "The FastText models all return word embeddings of a dimension of 300. This means that each token in our data would have a dimension of 600 from embedding the word and lemma alone. Even though we have quite a lot of data to work with, such a huge dimensionality significantly increases the risk of overfitting. On top of that it can introduce memory issues.<br>\n",
    "We reduce the dimensionality from 300 to 50 via 'Principal Component Analysis' (PCA). The PCA allows us to reduce the dimensionality effectively, such that we do not lose information than necessary. The illustration below shows the explained variance ratio as a function of components. Our choice of 50 components capture roughly 65% of the variability in our embeddings.\n",

The class has a method 'getEmbedding' which returns the word embeddings if the token is found in our FastText model, otherwise it returns an array of zeros before the PCA transformation. Furthermore, we append an indicator of 0.0 if the token was found in the model or 1.0 if it did not. This indicator is appended after the PCA transformation to avoid it being distorted. This principle is illustrated below:\n",

The reason for why it stretches from 10% to 45%, is that the F1-score for the `Hyponym` label is maximized around 10%, while the F1-score for `Synonyms` is maximized around 45%. This is simply due to different distributions in the train and dev set. As the total F1-score is maximized at 45%, this will be chosen in the final prediction. "

    "We choose to use pre-trained word embeddings to keep the number of trainable parameters low. We do not believe that our data is rich and vast enough to train meaningful embeddings without serious overfitting. On top of that, we chose to restrict ourselves to a embedding vector length of 50 via PCA. This is vital when considering that we use both token and lemma embeddings.<br>\n",

This allows our model to fit these tags more closely to our data, while keeping the number of parameters low as a consequence of the small embedding dimension. <br>\n",
    "We do not train embeddings on distances since we would risk serious overfitting for entity pairs with extreme distances. In particular, we could risk extrapolating if DEV/TEST has more extreme distances than we encounter in TRAIN.\n",

    "Instead of using an LSTM/bi-directional LSTM, we decided to use a CNN for our model. The lack of success from bi-LSTM in the 2nd assignment inspired us to try the CNN architecture. In the SemEval 2017 ScienceIE article, the group with CNN architecture outperformed the rest - a great motivation to try this architecture ourselves.\n",
