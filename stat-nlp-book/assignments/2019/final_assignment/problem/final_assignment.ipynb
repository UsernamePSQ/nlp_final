    "In this assignment, you will build a relation extraction model for scientific articles based on the [ScienceIE dataset](https://scienceie.github.io/) in a group of up to 3 students. This is the same dataset that was used for Assignment 2, where you had to train a model to extract keyphrases. You are welcome to build on code any team member already wrote for Assignment 2.\n",

    "You will build and train relation extraction models on the ScienceIE dataset. For this, you will also need to do data preprocessing to convert the ScienceIE data into a format suitable for training a relation extraction models. \n",

    "Your mark will depend on:\n",
    "\n",
    "* your **reasoning behind modelling choices** made\n",
    "* the correct **implementations** of your relation extraction models, and\n",
    "* the **performance** of your models on a held-out test set.\n",

    "As with the previous assignment, since we have to run the notebooks of all students, and because writing efficient code is important, your notebook should run in 10 minutes at most, including package loading time, on your machine.\n",
    "Furthermore, you are welcome to provide a saved version of your model with loading code. In this case loading, testing, and evaluation has to be done in 10 minutes. You can use the dev set to check if this is the case, and assume that it will be fine for the held-out test set if so."

    "Failure of structural components is a major concern in the nuclear power industry and represents not only a safety issue, but also a hazard to economic performance. Stress corrosion cracking (SCC), and especially intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC), have proved to be a significant potential cause of failures in the nuclear industry in materials such as Alloy 600 (74% Ni, 16% Cr and 8% Fe) and stainless steels, especially in Pressurised Water Reactors (PWR) [1–5]. Stress corrosion cracking in pressurized water reactors (PWSCC) occurs in Alloy 600 in safety critical components, such as steam generator tubes, heater sleeves, pressurized instrument penetrations and control rod drive mechanisms [2,6,7]. Understanding the mechanisms that control SCC in this alloy will allow for continued extensions of life in current plant as well as safer designs of future nuclear reactors.\n",
