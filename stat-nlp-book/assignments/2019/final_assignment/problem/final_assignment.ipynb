    "In this assignment, you will build a relation extraction model for scientific articles based on the [ScienceIE dataset](https://scienceie.github.io/) in a group of up to 3 students. This is the same dataset that was used for Assignment 2, where you had to train a model to extract keyphrases. You are welcome to build on code any team member already wrote for Assignment 2.\n",

    "* your **reasoning behind modelling choices** made\n",

    "Furthermore, you are welcome to provide a saved version of your model with loading code. In this case loading, testing, and evaluation has to be done in 10 minutes. You can use the dev set to check if this is the case, and assume that it will be fine for the held-out test set if so."

    "Failure of structural components is a major concern in the nuclear power industry and represents not only a safety issue, but also a hazard to economic performance. Stress corrosion cracking (SCC), and especially intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC), have proved to be a significant potential cause of failures in the nuclear industry in materials such as Alloy 600 (74% Ni, 16% Cr and 8% Fe) and stainless steels, especially in Pressurised Water Reactors (PWR) [1–5]. Stress corrosion cracking in pressurized water reactors (PWSCC) occurs in Alloy 600 in safety critical components, such as steam generator tubes, heater sleeves, pressurized instrument penetrations and control rod drive mechanisms [2,6,7]. Understanding the mechanisms that control SCC in this alloy will allow for continued extensions of life in current plant as well as safer designs of future nuclear reactors.\n",
