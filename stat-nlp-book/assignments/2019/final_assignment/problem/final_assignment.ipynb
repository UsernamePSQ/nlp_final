Stress corrosion cracking (SCC), and especially intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC), have proved to be a significant potential cause of failures in the nuclear industry in materials such as Alloy 600 (74% Ni, 16% Cr and 8% Fe) and stainless steels, especially in Pressurised Water Reactors (PWR) [1–5]. Stress corrosion cracking in pressurized water reactors (PWSCC) occurs in Alloy 600 in safety critical components, such as steam generator tubes, heater sleeves, pressurized instrument penetrations and control rod drive mechanisms [2,6,7]. Understanding the mechanisms that control SCC in this alloy will allow for continued extensions of life in current plant as well as safer designs of future nuclear reactors.\n",

You are not required to change the relation extraction model architure, i.e. it is fine to re-use the one from Task 1, but instead, the requirements are to implement one or more weak supervision strategies.\n",

    "Some possible weak supervision methods for relation extraction will be introduced in the lecture Week 43 (https://github.com/copenlu/stat-nlp-book/blob/master/chapters/relation_extraction_slides.ipynb); the following blog post also serves as a good introduction to this topic: https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/blog/ws_blog_post.html\n",

    "\n",
    "The general setup will otherwise be the same as for Task 1:\n",
    "As input to it, you will have the plain input texts as well as `.ann` files containing gold (i.e. correct) keyphrase annotations. The output should be `.ann` files containing relations between those keyphrases.\n",

    "**Important notes**:\n",
    "- You must provide code for the functions below. \n",
    "- If running them on the full dataset exceeds the 10 minute limit, you are welcome to additionally provide a line of code that (down)loads the already weakly annotated data.\n",
