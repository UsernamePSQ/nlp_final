    "In this assignment, you will build a relation extraction model for scientific articles based on the [ScienceIE dataset](https://scienceie.github.io/) in a group of up to 3 students. This is the same dataset that was used for Assignment 2, where you had to train a model to extract keyphrases. You are welcome to build on code any team member already wrote for Assignment 2.\n",

Stress corrosion cracking in pressurized water reactors (PWSCC) occurs in Alloy 600 in safety critical components, such as steam generator tubes, heater sleeves, pressurized instrument penetrations and control rod drive mechanisms [2,6,7].
